## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP has gained significant attention and importance in recent years due to its wide range of applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, text classification, and many others.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to NLP, covering various aspects of the field, from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques. It provides explanations, code examples, and resources to help you grasp the underlying principles and implement NLP solutions effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with NLP, you need a basic understanding of programming and Python. Familiarity with concepts like machine learning and statistics will also be beneficial. If you're new to NLP, it's recommended to follow the content in sequential order, starting from the basics and gradually moving towards more advanced topics.

## NLP Basics

In the NLP Basics section, you will learn about the foundational concepts and techniques used in natural language processing. This includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and syntactic parsing. You will also explore various linguistic resources and libraries commonly used in NLP, such as NLTK, SpaCy, and CoreNLP.

## Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP that involves transforming raw text into a clean and structured format suitable for further analysis. In this section, you will delve into techniques like removing stop words, handling punctuation, dealing with noisy data, normalizing text, and performing spell checking. Additionally, you will explore regular expressions, a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation.

## Text Representation

To make the textual data understandable to machine learning algorithms, it needs to be converted into numerical representations. In the Text Representation section, you will learn about various approaches, including bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and n-grams. Additionally, you will explore advanced techniques like word vectors and document embeddings, which capture semantic relationships between words and documents.

## Language Modeling

Language modeling is a fundamental task in NLP, aimed at predicting the probability of a sequence of words. In this section, you will learn about n-gram models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers. You will implement these models and train them on large-scale text datasets to generate coherent and context-aware text.

## Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their semantic and syntactic properties. In this section, you will explore popular word embedding models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. You will learn how to train word embeddings on custom datasets and utilize pre-trained embeddings for various NLP tasks

, such as word similarity, word analogy, and sentiment analysis.

## Sequence Modeling

Sequences play a vital role in NLP, as they capture the temporal dependencies present in text. In this section, you will dive into sequence modeling techniques like hidden Markov models (HMMs), conditional random fields (CRFs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). You will apply these models to tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation.

## NLP Applications

The NLP Applications section explores real-world use cases and applications of NLP. You will discover how to build sentiment analysis systems, text classification models, question answering systems, chatbots, and machine translation systems using state-of-the-art NLP techniques and frameworks. Code examples and practical projects will be provided to help you apply your knowledge in real scenarios.
